Description: Provide limited super user privileges (with LDAP support)
 Sudo is a program designed to allow a sysadmin to give limited root
 privileges to users and log root activity.  The basic philosophy is to give
 as few privileges as possible but still allow people to get their work done.
 .
 This version is built with LDAP support, which allows an equivalent of the
 sudoers database to be distributed via LDAP.  Authentication is still
 performed via pam.
